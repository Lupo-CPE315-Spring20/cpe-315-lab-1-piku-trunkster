# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku

* Damien Trunkey (No nickname)
* Status of your lab
  * Complete
  * Took me a while to think of a piku...
* Compilation and execution instructions
  * `gcc -o piku piku.s'
  * `./piku`
* Issues that you encountered along the way, and anything you have questions about.
  * Does the name of our excutable matter as long as it works or is there a proper
    naming convention we should follow?
  * Also how can we create a MakeFile for .s files? You said we can use gcc or make,
    on Friday can you touch up on that?
